**Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident**

**Issue Summary:**

- **Duration:**  
  - Start Time: March 15, 2023, 10:00 UTC
  - End Time: March 15, 2023, 12:30 UTC
- **Impact:**  
  - The outage affected our primary web application, causing it to be completely inaccessible for approximately 2.5 hours.
  - Users experienced error messages when trying to access the application, leading to a 100% outage for all users during this period.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings. A recent change in the load balancer configuration caused it to incorrectly route traffic, leading to a complete disruption of service.

**Timeline:**

- **10:00 UTC:** Issue detected by monitoring system alerting on increased error rates.
- **10:05 UTC:** Enginner noticed the alert and began investigation.
- **10:15 UTC:** Assumption made that the issue was related to database connectivity due to recent database maintenance.
- **10:30 UTC:** Database team was escalated to investigate the database connectivity, but no issues were found.
- **11:00 UTC:** Network team was escalated to investigate potential network issues, but no anomalies were found.
- **11:30 UTC:** Load balancer team identified misconfiguration in load balancer settings causing incorrect routing.
- **12:00 UTC:** Load balancer settings were corrected, and service was restored.
- **12:30 UTC:** Full service restoration confirmed.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

The root cause of the issue was a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, specifically related to routing rules. This misconfiguration led to all incoming traffic being directed to a non-functional backend server, resulting in the complete outage of the web application.

To resolve the issue, the load balancer settings were reverted to their previous state before the misconfiguration. Additionally, monitoring was enhanced to alert on similar misconfigurations in the future.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

- **Load Balancer Configuration Review:** Conduct a thorough review of load balancer configurations to ensure they are correct and match the intended routing rules.
- **Monitoring Enhancement:** Improve monitoring to quickly detect and alert on misconfigurations or anomalies in load balancer settings.
- **Change Management Process:** Implement stricter change management processes for load balancer configurations to prevent similar issues in the future.
- **Training and Education:** Provide additional training for engineers on load balancer configurations and best practices.

**Conclusion:**

The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, which resulted in a complete disruption of service for our web application. Through quick detection and resolution, we were able to restore service within a few hours. Moving forward, we will implement corrective and preventative measures to mitigate the risk of similar issues occurring in the future.
